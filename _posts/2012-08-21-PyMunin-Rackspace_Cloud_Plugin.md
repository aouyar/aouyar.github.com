excerpt: |
         The Rackspace Cloud Plugin was contributed to PyMunin project 
         by [palewire](https://github.com/palewire) (Brian Welsh). This is the
         first plugin that has been contributed by someone else, so I am quite
         happy about it; thanks to Brian we have a Rackspace Cloud Plugin now. :-)
