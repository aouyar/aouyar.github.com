The APC PHP Cache Plugin was updated to add the following graphs for monitoring 
fragmentation of memory.: 
   * php_apc_fragment_ratio
   * php_apc_fragment_count
   * php_apc_fragment_avgsize

A new version of PyMunin has been uploaded to 
[PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyMunin/). You can check the 
[Plugin Documentation](/PyMunin/plugins/phpapc.html) for more information on the 
plugin.

I would be glad to have feedback on the changes. Plus it could be great to 
have some sample graphs to publish on the website.
