The Varnish Cache Plugin was updated to correct some erroneous graphs and some 
additional graphs were implemented. The complete list of graphs is as follows: 
* varnish_requests
* varnish_hits
* varnish_client_conn
* varnish_backend_conn
* varnish_traffic
* varnish_workers
* varnish_work_queue
* varnish_memory
* varnish_expire_purge

You can check the [Plugin Documentation](/PyMunin/plugins/varnish.html) for more
information on the plugin.

I would be glad to have feedback on the changes. Plus it could be great to 
have some sample graphs to publish on the website.
