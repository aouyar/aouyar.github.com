title: Reimplementation of MAC-SSH
category: MAC-Telnet
prjname: MAC-Telnet
excerpt: |
         To facilitate tracking of upstream changes in _MAC-Telnet_ client 
         ( _mactelnet_ ) and server ( _mactelnetd_ ), the _MAC-SSH_ 
         functionality was re-implemented as command line options for 
         _MAC-Telnet_ client and server executables and the _macssh_ and 
         _macsshd_ executables were removed. Once the re-implementation was 
         over, all upstream changes to the code were merged.
