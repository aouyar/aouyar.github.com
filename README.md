GitHub User Page
================

GitHub User Page for [aouyar](https://github.com/aouyar)
([Ali Onur Uyar](http://aouyar.github.com)).

Instead of creating separate Git Branches (_gh-pages_) for each project, 
a folder is created  below _prj_ for each to facilitate sharing of  code for 
layout and styles between the web pages of different projects.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a simple, blog aware, static site generator is 
used for transforming the code into a static website, that is published at
GitHub. [YAML CSS Framework](http://www.yaml.de/) is used for layout and style.

The code for the site might server as an example for building a flexible and
accesible static website by combining
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [YAML CSS Framework](http://www.yaml.de/).

The code of the web site is published under 
[Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) 
(CC-BY 3.0) with the condition that a backlinks to the GitHub Site for the 
project 
[https://github.com/aouyar/aouyar.github.com](https://github.com/aouyar/aouyar.github.com)
and the YAML homepage [http://www.yaml.de](http://www.yaml.de) are provided
in a suitable place (e.g.: footer of the website or in the imprint).

Using the code as a guide for constructing your own website is covered under 
fair use rights, so if you are building a web site using [YAML CSS Framework](http://www.yaml.de/)
just give links to the original authors,
